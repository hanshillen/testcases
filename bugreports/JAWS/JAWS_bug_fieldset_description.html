	<h1>JAWS test case: Aria-describedby text on fieldset not read in IE</h1>
	
	<p>The fieldset below has a legend element as well as an additional description provided by <code>aria-describedby</code>. When moving focus into the fieldset, the expectation is that both the legend text and descriptive text will be announced. Instead, the text associated with <code>aria-describedby</code> is ignored in Internet Explorer. In Firefox the description is correctly announced by JAWS after the legend text.</p>
	<button>test 1</button>
	<fieldset aria-describedby="fieldsetDesc">
		<legend>Contact Details</legend>
		<p id="fieldsetDesc">All fields are required</p>
		<button>test 2</button>
	</fieldset>
	<button>test 3</button>
